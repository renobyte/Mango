        or MangaReader.net) to ask them to fix them.

        Please note that the developer of Mango does not actually upload or host any content; Mango is sort of like a search engine that directs you to the manga you want
        to read. Unfortuantely this means that missing pages or chapters are not under our control.

        Try reading the manga on a different manga source (for example, if you\'re using MangaFox, try MangaReader instead) and see if the missing pages appear.
