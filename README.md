# Mango
Mango was an *manga* (Japanese comic) reader created in 2010, originally for BlackBerry smartphones before being ported to Android in 2011.

Though no longer usable without its accompanying web service to handle scraping and parsing HTML, normalizing manga metadata, and providing JSON-formmated data back to the app via an HTTP API, I've released the code here under the GPLv3.
